# Sum of All Fears Coding Challenge
Sum of All Fears is a coding challenge that requires the programmer to write a program that uses a hard-coded array of [10, 15, 3, 7] and allows the user to enter a value for K. The program will return true if any of the numbers in the array add up to what was input  as a value for K, or false if they do not.

Technologies used to write this simple program are, HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap framework for the UI, and JavaScript and jQuery for the functionality.
